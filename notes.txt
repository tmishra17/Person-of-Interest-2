** deconstructs dictionary

# no classification needed, turning images and text into vector embeddings and points
# in a vector space, where the semantic meanings of the text will be directly compared to the 
# semantic meanings of the images


# tokens are numeric representation of texts, words, images, Neural Networks only understand numbers, 
# thus the tokens coverts the word/image in to a numerical representation
# Attention mechanism assigns meaning by comparing tokens in data
# embeddings are tokens converted into vector types


# sentence transformers vs transformers with mean pooling
